### EDA on Python about COVID-19 Cases in the City of Manila from 2020-2023

<br><br>

We used COVID-19 Data from the Dept. of Health for this Capstone Project.

Performed the Following:

<br>


**1. ROCCC for the Reliability of the Dataset**

The dataset follows the ROCCC Analysis as described below:
- Reliable - yes, not biased
- Original - yes, can locate the original public data
- Comprehensive - yes, not missing important information
- Current - yes, updated monthly
- Cited - yes

<br><br>



**2. Data Cleaning**

We dealt with 5 batches with around 4.1 million rows of data in total

- Filtered the dataset to only include data from “City of Manila”
- Checked for Duplicates
- Checked for Missing/Null Values
- Dropped Unnecessary Columns
- Replaced the null values with an appropriate data like “Not Recorded”
- Merged the five cleaned datasets into one

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**

We performed multiple Data Visualizations
